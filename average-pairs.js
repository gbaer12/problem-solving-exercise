/** Average Pair 
 * 
 * Write a function called averagePair. Given a sorted array of integers and a target average, determine if there is a pair of values in the array where the average of the pair equals the target average. There may be more than one pair that matches the average target.

Constraints:

Time Complexity: O(N)

Examples:

averagePair([1, 2, 3], 2.5); // true
averagePair([1, 3, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 19], 8); // true
averagePair([-1, 0, 3, 4, 5, 6], 4.1); // false
averagePair([], 4); // false
*/

/** * The function relies on the fact that the array is sorted
 *  to calculate the running average of every two numbers.
 *  It does this by putting one pointer at the start of the
 *  array and one pointer at the end of the array.
 *
 *  At each point, if the average is less than the target num, we have to
 *  move the left pointer up, while the right can stay put. Otherwise if
 *  the average is greater than the sum, we move the right pointer down.
 *
 *  The function ends either when we've found the correct average, or
 *  the pointers have crossed paths (i.e. when the start is greater than the end),
 *  at which point we can conclude there is no truthy answer. */

function averagePair(arr, num) {
  let start = 0; // left pointer
  let end = arr.length - 1; //right pointer
